# self-learninig-chatbot
This Python script is a basic chatbot application built using Tkinter. It operates in two modes: non-teach and teach mode. In non-teach mode, it responds to user questions based on pre-existing data. It uses the difflib library to find the closest matching question and retrieves the corresponding answer. Teach mode allows users to contribute new answers to unanswered questions. The chatbot prompts users to teach it when it encounters an unfamiliar question. If the user decides to teach, the new question-answer pair is added to the database. This interactive approach enhances the chatbot's learning capabilities, making it a versatile tool for conversations.
